- Documentation Guidelines:-

Documentation is an essential component of the project as it serves to provide readers and developers with a comprehensive understanding of the project's purpose and progress. Our intention is to document each stage of the project, even if certain phases are not yet complete. We label these stages as incomplete to indicate that they are still in progress, ensuring that readers are aware of their ongoing nature. By maintaining thorough documentation, we aim to facilitate better comprehension and transparency throughout the development process.
